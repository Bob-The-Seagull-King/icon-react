        "name": "Yeokin",
        "description": "The vast majority of people in Arden Eld live in the Green, the swathes of peaceful farmland, villages, townships, and trading posts in between the arkenruins. Life in the villages is hard work but generally pleasant, and organized around the yearly harvests. Neighboring villages tend to depend on each other for trade, safety, and information, and come together for festivals (of which there are many, especially in the summer months). The villages typically are run by a city elder, or a council of elders and have a strong connection to nature and its cycles. Faithful villagers tend to pay their respects to the local nature spirits or the Titans at shrines or holy sites such as pools or groves.<br/><br/>Villagers tend to be proud of their local traditions, festivals, and gods. Most villages have a regional cooking or craft specialty, and people will often visit from many towns over just to sample them. One village might specialize in iron and smithing work, another might be known for the quality of its steamed buns and its pork, and another might have miles of beautiful grazing pastures and be known for the quality of its milk and dairy products.<br/><br/>Regional village councils sometimes will gather a militia to defend against a surfacing ruin or a blight, and those towns very close to the ruins typically have a wall to keep out roaming monsters. Many villages, especially those deep in the wilderness, will train some or most of their members in old martial arts techniques unique to each village that can be used to defend the village in times of crisis, recording these techniques on scrolls that are closely kept secrets.",
        "values": "<b>Community, hard work, respect for nature, and family</b> are string values for Yeokin. Outsiders can sometimes see them as parochial, stubborn, and uneducated."
