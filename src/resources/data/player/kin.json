        "description": "The Aethrynn, or Thrynn (most commonly) are found everywhere across Arden Eld. They are an adaptable, diverse people with a strong sensitivity to Aether and a strong connection to arkentech, some say because they are direct descendants of the Arken that survived or fled the Doom and the dark age that followed. They make up a large part of airship crews and captains in the great Guilds due to their potential for aether sensitivity making them excellent pilots.<br/><br/>Thrynn are made up of a dazzling swathe of backgrounds that span the continent. They tend to live in clans that cluster into villages, towns, and city associations. Symbology and culture of the ancient Thrynn clans, called the Seven Families, are present in many modern cultures of Arden Eld, and some draw strength and purpose from their ancient texts and teachings.<br/><br/>Some Thrynn will occasionally have small glowing ‘star-marks’ on their body, especially when attuned to or channeling strong sources of Aether. These can form constellations of stars or twisting branch-like patterns under their skin. Occasionally these marks are strong enough that even being near to a strong source of Aether is enough to light them up.<br/><br/>Very rarely, Thrynn are born with delicate vestigial insect-like wings, not capable of flight. Children born this way are given special attention, having been divinely marked, and often have roles in the community leadership or priesthood prepared for them. They may grow into these roles or eventually reject them."
