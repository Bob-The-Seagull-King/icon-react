A select order of priests committed all the great and necessary knowledge of Kin to memory, creating a single, continuous song, known as the Great Chant. In myths, stories, and histories, they recorded the knowledge of the ancients, transforming it into liturgy. <br/>The Chant performed its role, and it was through its power that the early bands of Kin survived and persevered through the darkest days. Today, however, it is so archaic, convoluted, and long that many dispute the meaning of its dogma, though none can deny its value as a mythic text. The Old Church of the chroniclers has splintered into factions that mostly squabble over its meaning and try to draw some angle from its numerous and sometimes contradictory adaptions into holy texts. <br/>Nevertheless, the Chant still holds power - real, tangible power - to heal, mend, and uplift. There are still those that take to the road and use its awesome power for good, ringing the bells of awakening and purification, as they sing to victory.",
