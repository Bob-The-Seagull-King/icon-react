Welcome to ICONpendium, the free browser-reference tool for\ 
the ICON ttrpg (currently tracking version 1.5). As an open\
source project, we're always open to new contributors to help\
with data entry and testing. Contact Bob (@KingOfSeagulls on\
twitter) to get added as a contributor.

# Roadmap

Our next planned steps for the project are to add as much of\
the playbook as possible, as well as tools to help groups and\
players build and play their characters.

In the immediate future, our next planned additions are:
<ul>
    <li>Camp item information</li>
    <li>Narrative bond data</li>
    <li>Narrative player builder</li>
    <li>Combat glossary</li>
</ul>
